# How to Toggle Between Completed/Incompleted Items
The user can add as many items as they wanted to and in order to toggle between completed and incompleted items, the user must click on the item twice to change its completed status from false to true (the default status of completed is false because the user has not completed the item yet) and then the checkbox toggles the completed items so if it were checked, only the incompleted items would show on the list.

# How to Clear
The user can add as many items as they wanted but instead of removing each item one by one, the clear button clears the entire list.
